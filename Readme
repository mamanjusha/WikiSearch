Purpose of this project is to build index and retrieval engine on wikipedia documents.

There will be 3 main stages

1.Build index from wikidump

input: wikidump folder
output: index folder in following format
One index file will be created for every 10 wiki documents. While building index stop words will be removed
and words will be stemmed.
All the words in index document are sorted by word and type.

ex: index file1   manchi_1=id1  2, id2 3
                  manju_2=id1 3, id2 1
     index file2    manchi_1=id4 2, id5 2
                    manjui_2=id4 1, id5 2
From the example above there are 2 index files created sorted by word. 
In index file1 manchi word present in title section in id1 and id2 pages 2,3 times respectively.
manju word present in category section in id1 and id2 pages 3,1 times respectively.

In index file2 manchi word present in title section in id4 and id5 pages 2,2 times respectively.
manju word present in category section in id4 and id5 pagess 1,2 times respectively.

2.Build second level index on index files <TODO>
3.Build retrieval engine on wikidump <TODO>
